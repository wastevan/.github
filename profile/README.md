# WasteVan - Decentralized Waste Management Platform

## Problem Statement

Traditional waste management systems often lack transparency, accountability, and effective incentives for sustainable practices. This leads to inefficient waste collection, environmental pollution, and a lack of community engagement. There's a need for a system that promotes responsible waste disposal, tracks impact transparently, and rewards individuals for their contributions, fostering a more sustainable and community-driven approach to waste management.

## Our Team

## EcoConnect

Blockchain technology to enhance transparency and efficiency. 

Potential for growth in blockchain-based waste management: The increasing adoption of blockchain in supply chain and environmental solutions creates a fertile ground for EcoConnect. 

Target audience and demographics:  

Environmentally conscious individuals and households. 

Waste collection agents and recycling facilities. 

Corporations seeking to improve their environmental footprint. 

Municipalities and NGOs focused on waste management solutions. 

## Product Overview 

EcoConnect is a decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to report plastic waste collection, earn tokens, and track the lifecycle of their waste. Agents verify collections and ensure responsible disposal, with a streamlined process facilitated by QR code technology. 

 

Key features and functionalities:  

Plastic waste reporting and QR code generation: Users report plastic waste, and the system generates a unique QR code for each submission. 

Agent notification: Agents within the user's region receive real-time notifications of available waste collection requests. 

Agent waste collection and QR code scanning: Agents collect the waste and scan the user's QR code to confirm collection. 

Automated token distribution: Based on the type and quantity of plastic, tokens are automatically distributed to the user upon successful QR code scan by the agent. 

Lifecycle tracking: Transparent tracking of plastic waste from collection to recycling or disposal. 

Verified agent network: A network of verified agents ensures responsible waste handling. 

Agent point purchase: Agents purchase points to distribute to users. 

Community dashboard: Allows users to interact and see collective impact. 

Performance Analytics: Agents can track collection statistics. 

 

## Technology Stack 
EcoConnect is built on the Ethereum blockchain, chosen for its robust smart contract capabilities and widespread adoption. 

Technical architecture of EcoConnect:  

Smart Contracts: Written in Solidity, managing token distribution, waste tracking, and agent verification. 

Frontend: Next.js 15 (App Router), React, and TailwindCSS for a responsive user interface. 

Web3 Integration: ethers.js for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. 

Authentication: MetaMask wallet integration for secure user access. 

Data Storage: On-chain for critical transaction data and off-chain for user profiles and non-sensitive information. 

Security measures and protocols:  

Smart contract audits by reputable third-party firms. 

Secure wallet management and encryption of sensitive data. 

 

## User Experience 

EcoConnect is designed to be user-friendly, encouraging widespread adoption and participation. 

How users interact with EcoConnect:  

Sign up and create a profile. 

Report plastic waste collection, specifying the type and quantity. 

Receive a generated QR code for the reported waste. 

Await notification and collection by a verified agent. 

Receive tokens automatically upon agent QR code scan. 

Track the lifecycle of their collected plastic. 

View community impact and participate in events. 

## How Agents Interact with EcoConnect 

Sign up and create a profile. NB: An agent would be required to buy some points during the registration process 

The agent would have to approved by admin after he creates a profile before he can perform the activities of an agent 

After approval, he can go around and collect the plastics and reward the users accordingly 

He can purchase more points when he runs out of points. 

## Onboarding process  

Simplified sign-up process with wallet integration. 

In-app tutorials on how to report waste and understand the QR code system. 

Clear and concise information about the token reward system and its benefits. 

Clear and concise information about the benefits of participating. 

## Example use cases and scenarios:  

Household waste collection: A user reports plastic bottles and containers, receives a QR code, and an agent collects them, triggering token distribution. 

Agent-driven collection: Agents receive notifications for nearby waste reports, efficiently collect waste, and confirm collection with QR code scans. 

## Business Model 

Revenue Streams and Monetization Strategy:  

Transaction Fees on Agent Point Purchases: EcoConnect generates revenue through transaction fees associated with agents purchasing points. 

Data Analytics and Reporting: Offering premium data analytics and reporting services to municipalities, corporations, and research institutions that want to track plastic waste trends and impact.
