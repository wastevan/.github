# WasteVan - Decentralized Waste Management Platform

## Problem Statement

Traditional waste management systems often lack transparency, accountability, and effective incentives for sustainable practices. This leads to inefficient waste collection, environmental pollution, and a lack of community engagement. There's a need for a system that promotes responsible waste disposal, tracks impact transparently, and rewards individuals for their contributions, fostering a more sustainable and community-driven approach to waste management.

## Our Team

## EcoConnect

Blockchain technology to enhance transparency and efficiency. 

Potential for growth in blockchain-based waste management: The increasing adoption of blockchain in supply chain and environmental solutions creates a fertile ground for EcoConnect. 

Target audience and demographics:  

Environmentally conscious individuals and households. 

Waste collection agents and recycling facilities. 

Corporations seeking to improve their environmental footprint. 

Municipalities and NGOs focused on waste management solutions. 

## Product Overview 

EcoConnect is a decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to report plastic waste collection, earn tokens, and track the lifecycle of their waste. Agents verify collections and ensure responsible disposal, with a streamlined process facilitated by QR code technology. 

 

Key features and functionalities:  

Plastic waste reporting and QR code generation: Users report plastic waste, and the system generates a unique QR code for each submission. 

Agent notification: Agents within the user's region receive real-time notifications of available waste collection requests. 

Agent waste collection and QR code scanning: Agents collect the waste and scan the user's QR code to confirm collection. 

Automated token distribution: Based on the type and quantity of plastic, tokens are automatically distributed to the user upon successful QR code scan by the agent. 

Lifecycle tracking: Transparent tracking of plastic waste from collection to recycling or disposal. 

Verified agent network: A network of verified agents ensures responsible waste handling. 

Agent point purchase: Agents purchase points to distribute to users. 

Community dashboard: Allows users to interact and see collective impact. 

Performance Analytics: Agents can track collection statistics.
