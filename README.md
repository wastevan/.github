# WasteVan - Decentralized Waste Management Platform

## Problem Statement

Traditional waste management systems often lack transparency, accountability, and effective incentives for sustainable practices. This leads to inefficient waste collection, environmental pollution, and a lack of community engagement. There's a need for a system that promotes responsible waste disposal, tracks impact transparently, and rewards individuals for their contributions, fostering a more sustainable and community-driven approach to waste management.
